                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "When the work is accomplished and the person withdraws, this is the way of Heaven."</li>
                    <li>Standard text: "When achievement is reached and the person withdraws, this is the way of Heaven."</li>

                        <li>"功成" (gōng chéng) can be understood as the completion of work or achieving success, emphasizing the finality and completeness of an accomplishment.</li>
                        <li>"功遂" (gōng suì) highlights the idea of success or fulfillment, suggesting a broader interpretation of achievement that aligns more closely with the process rather than the endpoint.</li>

                    <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>Earlier text (Guodian/Mawangdui): Focuses on the completion of tasks and the natural withdrawal after the achievement, reflecting a practical and process-oriented view of action.</li>
                        <li>Later text: Shifts toward the notion of triumph or fulfillment as the realization of potential, leading to withdrawal, which aligns more with moral satisfaction and self-cultivation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version emphasizes the process of achieving a goal and then naturally stepping back, indicative of a cycle of work and rest:</li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>It suggests an inherent pattern in nature and human action, where accomplishing tasks leads to stepping back to allow the natural order to continue.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The later standard text leans towards individual fulfillment and the realization of one's potential:</li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>It presents a more individualized take on success, focusing on the moral or ethical implications of achieving one's goals before withdrawing.</li>
                    <li>The text reflects a shift from a concrete understanding of accomplishment to a more abstract interpretation involving personal growth and philosophical introspection.</li>
                </ul>
