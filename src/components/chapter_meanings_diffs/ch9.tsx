                <li><strong className="font-semibold">"功成身退，天之道" vs. "功遂身退天之道"</strong></li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "When the work is accomplished and the person withdraws, this is the way of Heaven."</li>
                    <li>Standard text: "When achievement is reached and the person withdraws, this is the way of Heaven."</li>
                    <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>"功成" (gōng chéng) refers to the successful completion of a task or mission, highlighting the satisfaction that comes with a job well done. It's like reaching the summit after a long climb.</li>
                        <li>In contrast, "功遂" (gōng suì) brings to the forefront the broader concept of fulfillment, not just the endpoint. It reflects a journey, a path tread with purpose rather than just a finish line.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>Earlier text (Guodian/Mawangdui): Emphasizes completing tasks and gracefully stepping back afterward, echoing the natural rhythm of effort and pause. It may mirror the ancient world's focus on harmony with the natural flows and tides.</li>
                        <li>Later text: Veers toward an internal, moral victory. The sense of achieving not only a goal but inner contentment. There’s a reflection of self-development—a deeper awareness of one's place in the grand tapestry of existence.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version underscores a cycle—work completed, then rest ensues naturally:</li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>This perspective traces a simple yet profound understanding: all actions lead to a natural cessation, a rhythm embedded in the very fabric of nature itself.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The later standard text offers a more nuanced personal narrative:</li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>It paints a picture of individual growth—a story not just of outward success but also inner flourishing and self-reflection, resonating with someone who's seen beyond mere tasks.</li>
                    <li>This shift highlights an evolution in thought, from concrete achievement to pondering the essence of success—a reflection perhaps of changes in society where the individual's inner journey began to hold more sway.</li>
                </ul>
