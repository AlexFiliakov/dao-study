        <h3 className="font-bold">Key Differences and Their Implications:</h3>
        <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"非以其无私邪？" vs. "非以其无私耶？"</strong></li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "Is it not because he is selfless? (邪, xié)"</li>
                <li>Standard text: "Is it not because he is selfless? (耶, yé)"</li>
                <li>Implication of the Change:</li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>The ancient particle 邪 (xié) in the early texts is more than a mere question—it embodies a challenge, demanding the reader's engagement and mental rumination. It's as if the text is drawing you into a dialogue, beckoning with intensity:</li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>"Is it not precisely because he is selfless?"</li>
                        <li>This subtle invitation leads the reader to ponder deeply, to question and introspect.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>In contrast, 耶 (yé) in the later iterations of Classical Chinese provides a softer touch, guiding rather than provoking. It turns the inquiry into more of a confirmation:</li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>"Is it not because he is selfless?"</li>
                        <li>This alters the tone to one of affirmation, suggesting a truth already known or perhaps taken for granted, more instructive than inquisitive.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>Philosophical Shift:</li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version holds a sharper, more confrontational essence that seems to stir the soul into contemplation.</li>
                    <li>The later standard text mellows this effect, reinforcing it with the certainty of established wisdom rather than urging personal discovery.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version, with its rhetorical vigour, encourages a kind of philosophical introspection that resounds with curiosity and exploration.</li>
            <li>The standard text’s gentler, perhaps more soothing approach, presents selflessness as a known path to fulfillment—not needing much interrogation, rather an acknowledgment of a universally accepted truth.</li>
            <li>Both versions convey the timeless wisdom that true fulfillment springs from selflessness. Yet, the earlier text pulls the reader into an intimate dance of thoughts, while the latter prefers to gracefully guide us to the same insight, offering a comforting sense of understanding.</li>
