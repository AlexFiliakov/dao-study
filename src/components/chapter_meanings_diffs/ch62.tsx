      <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">"美言可以市尊" vs. "美言可以市，尊行可以加人"</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: In this version, the idea is that using beautiful words can directly procure respect, and taking beautiful actions can enhance one's life.</li>
          <li>Standard text: Here, beautiful words are set apart as tradeable, while respectful actions are said to have the power to inspire or influence others.</li>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The older text emphasizes a simple linkage between speaking, acting, and gaining value or stature as a result.</li>
            <li>The standard text differentiates between the value of words and actions, suggesting they function in separate capacities with distinct outcomes.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The early text reflects an integrated view where the harmony of words and deeds naturally brings about respect, speaking to an era of interconnected values.</li>
            <li>In contrast, the later text presents a more segmented view, possibly pointing to a growing awareness of the diverse pathways through which influence can be exerted.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">"求以得，有罪以免邪" vs. "以求得，有罪以免耶"</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: Here, there's an emphasis on the process—seeking as a condition of obtaining, with forgiveness on offer for offenses.</li>
          <li>Standard text: This phrasing leads directly from seeking to gaining, hinting at a certainty or inevitability of outcomes, with the same conditionality for forgiveness.</li>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The older phrase "求以得" seems to convey an exploratory or conditional relationship between seeking and attainment, a pursuit of possibilities.</li>
            <li>Conversely, "以求得" in the later text suggests a more direct and possibly assured relationship, possibly implying a trust in the very act of seeking as a means to achieve.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The earlier iteration leans towards a reflective understanding of causality—where cause, effort, and consequence are intimately tied, especially regarding morality and recompense.</li>
            <li>The later version offers a formulaic sense of causality, reflecting an evolving mindset that begins to see action as directly resulting in consequence, capturing a shift towards systemic understanding.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version accentuates a cohesive connection between speech and action, underlining their combined significance:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>It calls for a perspective that values both eloquence and deeds in enhancing individual and societal worth.</li>
          <li>Prompts introspection into how aspirations and behaviors might lead to results, particularly in realms of justice and ethics.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The later standard text delineates these ideas, painting a detailed landscape of philosophical thought:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>It presents distinct domains for speech and action, acknowledging their respective implications on societal dynamics.</li>
          <li>Depicts a more sophisticated ideology where actions predictably result in certain outcomes, influencing moral and ethical governance.</li>
          <li>While both texts uphold the fundamental Taoist belief in the profound influence of the Dao, they approach its significance with differing shades—one more unified, the other more analytical.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
