          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"美言可以市尊" vs. "美言可以市，尊行可以加人"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "Beautiful words can buy respect, and beautiful actions can add to a person."</li>
              <li>Standard text: "Beautiful words can be traded for; respectful actions can influence people."</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The older text suggests a direct correlation between speech, actions, and their resulting value or influence.</li>
                <li>The later text separates the notion of beautiful words (which can be exchanged) and respectful actions (which can influence others), suggesting two distinct results depending on one's approach.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Earlier text: Emphasizes the holistic value of both words and actions, suggesting that both can confer respect and value.</li>
                <li>Later text: Distinguishes between the effects of words and actions, suggesting a more nuanced understanding of influence where words and actions are traded or valued differently.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"求以得，有罪以免邪" vs. "以求得，有罪以免耶"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "Seeking leads to attainment, and crimes can be pardoned?"</li>
              <li>Standard text: "To seek and attain, crimes can be pardoned?"</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>"求以得" suggests a more procedural or conditional relationship between seeking and attaining.</li>
                <li>"以求得" seems to imply the means of seeking leading directly to attainment, perhaps indicating a more assured or inevitable outcome.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Older text (Guodian/Mawangdui): Suggests a consideration of cause and effect, indicating reflection on effort and result, particularly in the context of rewards and punishments.</li>
                <li>Later text: Indicates an almost formulaic approach to success and forgiveness, suggesting a more deterministic or confident view where actions lead directly to outcomes, with a recognition of forgiveness as a cosmological balance.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version is direct in its correlation between speech and action, highlighting their combined value in society:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Encourages a view that both speaking well and acting well contribute to personal and societal value.</li>
              <li>Invites reflection on how actions and desires might shape outcomes, particularly in justice and morality.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The later standard text separates and refines these ideas, offering a detailed philosophical view:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Distinguishes the domains of speech and action, and their influence on others distinctly.</li>
              <li>Presents a more sophisticated worldview where actions have assured consequences, influencing the moral and ethical guidance in governance and society.</li>
              <li>Both versions emphasize the core Taoist values of understanding the Dao's profound effect on everything, but they do so with different nuances—one more integrative and the other more systematic or procedural.</li>
