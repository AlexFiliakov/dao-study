      <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">"以其善下之" vs. "以其善下之"</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "It is because they are good at placing themselves below."</li>
          <li>Standard text: "It is because they are good at placing themselves below."</li>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>This phrase echoes through time with the same harmony, resonating with the beauty of humility. The idea is timeless: to lead, one must willingly stand lower, like a gentle ocean cradling myriad streams, commanding respect through quiet strength rather than force.</li>
            <li>The consistent use of this phrase across both versions suggests that the philosophy of humility has a revered place in Chinese thought, unfazed by centuries of change.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">"必以言下之" vs. "必以言下之"</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "They must use words to place themselves below."</li>
          <li>Standard text: "They must use words to place themselves below."</li>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>Despite different eras, both scripts agree on the power of humble communication in leadership. There's something deeply compelling about using speech not to dominate, but to respectfully position oneself as a servant-leader, letting actions speak softly alongside words.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">"以其不争，故天下莫能与之争" vs. "以其不争，故天下莫能与之争"</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "Because they do not strive, the world cannot strive against them."</li>
          <li>Standard text: "Because they do not strive, the world cannot strive against them."</li>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>This shared wisdom speaks volumes about a leadership style imbued with grace—a non-aggressive approach, inviting cooperation rather than confrontation. It reflects an unchanging truth that resonates with anyone who believes in peace over ambition.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version maintains a clear continuity with the later "standard text" in this chapter:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Both versions articulate a leadership philosophy that embraces humility and laissez-faire management, painting a portrait of wise authority through passive leadership.</li>
          <li>The texts resonate with a philosophy that remains compelling over centuries: the leader who avoids contention garners true influence, not through force, but by harmonizing with nature's flow.</li>
          <li>This timeless chapter invites us to embrace a style of governance that remains as serene as a calm sea, where the most effective leadership arises from serving and allowing natural processes to unfold.</li>
