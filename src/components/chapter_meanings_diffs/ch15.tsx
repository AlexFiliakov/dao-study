              <li>
                Guodian/Mawangdui: "Solemn, like a guest." A phrase that radiates with the warmth of hospitality, drawing on the universally respected etiquette of treating guests with honor and deference.
              </li>
              <li>
                Standard text: "Solemn, like the form." Here, the imagery shifts towards abstraction, perhaps inviting the reader to contemplate their internal composure and outer expression.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong>
              </li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>
                  The earlier text encourages an attitude imbued with humility and attentiveness, akin to the respect one provides a cherished visitor. This captures a social dynamic rooted in ancient Chinese customs that valued direct, interactive virtue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In contrast, the later text introduces a more philosophical perspective, prompting introspection into the concept of "form," which hints at a meditative probing of one's visible and invisible self.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>

                <li>
                  The older script centers on interpersonal conduct and societal roles, allying itself with pragmatic wisdom that the ancients revered for harmonious coexistence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Meanwhile, the evolution to "like the form" may reflect a growing intrigue in reflective thought, where the internal and existential aspects gain precedence over social action.

              </ul>

              <li>
                Guodian/Mawangdui: "Make the turbid still, and gradually it becomes clear." This provides an uplifting reassurance akin to the simple yet profound act of allowing mud to settle in water, revealing pristine depths.
              </li>
              <li>
                Standard text: "Who can make the turbid still and gradually becomes clear?" Here, the quiet self-assurance of the earlier advice transforms into a rhetorical challenge, sparking reflection on one's ability to achieve such serenity and clarity.

                <li>
                  As the narrative unfolds over time, it reshapes into a philosophical query, encouraging readers to engage in an introspective journey, assessing their capacity for mastering their inner turmoil.
