            <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li><strong className="font-semibold">"不知有之" vs. "下知有之"</strong></li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "The best leader is barely known to the people."</li>
                    <li>Standard text: "The best leader is known by the people below."</li>
                    <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>The earlier Guodian/Mawangdui text speaks of a leader who is almost imperceptible, promoting an ethos where governance is so seamless it becomes invisible. This reflects an ideal where the people remain blissfully unaware of the hand that guides them, much like the gentle flow of a river shaping the stones it passes.</li>
                        <li>In contrast, the later standard text acknowledges a leader who is acknowledged by their people, highlighting a more interactive and possibly visible role. This suggests a historical shift towards a more structured form of leadership, where recognition is not only an expectation but a responsibility.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>The ancient perspective emphasizes the virtue of subtlety in governance, an almost mystical presence that enacts change without disturbance.</li>
                        <li>As time progressed, philosophical thought reflects a societal move toward established hierarchies, where the leader's presence, like a guiding star, is acknowledged and perhaps, even necessary for order and harmony.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <li><strong className="font-semibold">"信不足焉，有不信焉" vs. "信不足，焉有不信焉"</strong></li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "When trust is insufficient, there is no trust."</li>
                    <li>Standard text: "When there is not enough trust, there is distrust."</li>
                    <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>The earlier text rings with a certain philosophical finality. It portrays trust as a state whose absence is all-consuming, nullifying its very possibility. This reflects an existential view where trust must be inherent and abundant for it to truly exist.</li>
                        <li>The later standard text moves to a more pragmatic understanding. Here, the deficiency of trust directly leads to suspicion and doubt, emphasizing the social interplay and consequences when trust falters.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>The older version suggests a foundational view of trust as a prerequisite — without it, society exists in a vacuum of distrust, an ominous void.</li>
                        <li>The adaptions of later periods underscore the practical wisdom of recognizing and managing trust, understanding its delicate balance within the living tapestry of social dynamics.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version focuses on a leadership style that’s artfully understated and resonates with the natural order:</li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>It places importance on an unobtrusive presence, suggesting that the most profound influence is quiet and organic.</li>
                    <li>Trust manifests as an elemental force, needing abundance to flourish in a community.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The later standard text captures a more structured view of governance and the complex dance of social relations:</li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>Here, the leader's recognized role within a hierarchy suggests necessary engagement and presence.</li>
                    <li>Reflects on the tangible effects of trust — its absence breeds distrust, affecting the cohesiveness of society.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </div>
