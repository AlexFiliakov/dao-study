      <h3 className="font-bold">Key Differences and Their Implications:</h3>
      <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">"惚兮恍兮" vs. "忽兮恍兮" and "恍兮惚兮" vs. "恍兮忽兮"</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>
            In the exquisite dance of the ancient characters, "惚" (hū) and "忽" (hū) might seem almost identical at first glance. But under the scrutiny of a sage, their hidden whispers reveal distinct tales about the Dao.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Guodian/Mawangdui text uses "惚" to paint the Dao with shades of mystery and a sense of the unfathomable. It's as if this version wants us to ponder the Dao as a dream just beyond our reach.
          </li>
          <li>
            The standard text replaces "惚" with "忽," injecting a suddenness and unpredictability into our understanding of the Dao. This suggests a universe ready to surprise, where change sweeps in like a swift, invigorating wind.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong>
          </li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>
              "惚" embodies the elusive and almost mystical nature of the Dao. In contrast, "忽" nudges us toward seeing it as fluid and ever-shifting, ready to reveal its secrets in a burst of revelation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong>
          </li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>
              The use of "惚" in Guodian/Mawangdui may align us more with the mystical tradition, encouraging a slower, deeper contemplation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Switching to "忽" in the standard text might mirror philosophical trends that embraced spontaneity and change as inherent aspects of existence.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">"自今及古" vs. "自古及今"</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>
            The Guodian/Mawangdui text takes us on a journey from the present to the past, "自今及古." It’s a perspective that places us right here, firmly in the now, before weaving through the tapestry of history.
          </li>
          <li>
            Conversely, the standard text begins from "自古及今," honoring the ancient roots of the Dao and tracing its path to today. This approach invites a reflection on the enduring nature of truth and tradition.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong>
          </li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>
              The Guodian/Mawangdui reads more like a call to recognize the Dao's presence in this moment. It's a reminder that the past is accessible from the present, weaving timelessness with immediacy.
            </li>
            <li>
              The standard version tells a story of continuity, where the ancient wisdom of the Dao flows toward us, carrying the weight and wisdom of generations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong>
          </li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>
              Guodian/Mawangdui urges us to embrace the Dao here and now, hinting at a philosophy that treasures the present moment's mysteries and truths. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The standard text encourages a view of the Dao as a timeless beacon guiding humanity throughout the ages—a philosophy rooted in continuity and consistency.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>
          The rendition found in Guodian/Mawangdui invites us into a world where the Dao's mysteries seem ever-present and poised on the edge of tangibility:
        </li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>
            It beckons the seeker to engage with the Dao's essence, almost spontaneously and with an open heart tuned to the present.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>
          The standard text, meanwhile, narrates a saga of the Dao that stretches through ages, resonating with the heartbeat of historical echoes:
        </li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>
            It underscores a vision of the Dao as a steadfast companion throughout humanity’s journey, never changing yet allowing for endless transformation in perception.
          </li>
          <li>
            Both versions envelop us with the Dao’s subtle, profound presence, yet they invite us to explore different facets—whether it's the captivating immediacy or the calm, enduring legacy.
