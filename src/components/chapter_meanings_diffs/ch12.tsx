          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"驰骋畋猎" vs. "驰骋田猎"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "Galloping and hunting (驰骋畋猎, chí chěng tián liè) make people's hearts lose control."</li>
              <li>Standard text: "Galloping and hunting (驰骋田猎, chí chěng tián liè) make people's hearts lose control."</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The difference lies in the character "畋" (tián) vs. "田" (tián). "畋" suggests focused, organized hunting, hinting at a possibly more intentional or methodical pursuit.</li>
                <li>"田" literally means field and is often associated with farming, it can imply a broader, more general space for hunting. The meaning in the context of hunting does not significantly change, but the nuance slightly shifts to imply a more expansive or pastoral setting.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: May emphasize a sense of targeting and acquiring specifically valued experiences or goods, hinting at pursuits that are methodical yet potentially consuming.</li>
                <li>Later text: Suggests an expansive, maybe less structured indulgence in pleasures or activities, possibly pointing at a more comprehensive sense of pursuit and distraction.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version seems to focus more on intentional pursuits:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>It implies a structured engagement in activities that distracts and impacts the heart/mind.</li>
              <li>This version emphasizes how having focused goals or targets in activities might lead to disturbance of inner peace.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The later standard text transitions to a broader view of indulgent behavior:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>It suggests that being consumed by a wide array of distractions, even those more universal such as the draw of nature, can lead to disturbances.</li>
              <li>It provides a more expansive understanding of the myriad ways indulgences can impact a person.</li>
              <li>Both versions emphasize the impact of outward indulgence on inner tranquility, but the former through methodical pursuits, and the latter through a broader range of distractions.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
