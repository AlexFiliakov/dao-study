                At first glance, both texts present the same wording: "反者道之动; 弱者道之用。天下万物生于有，有生于无。"
              </li>
              <li>
                Yet, the subtle evolution of linguistic and cultural contexts over centuries likely shaped how these characters were understood, even sparking new meanings across time.

                  In earlier times (Guodian/Mawangdui), the passage may have evoked a vivid sense of the Dao's inherent motion ('动') and gentle strength ('用'), reflecting an appreciation for the organic and spontaneous way of the universe.

                <li>
                  By the Three Kingdoms period, there may have been a shift—a deeper exploration into how these dynamics relate to broader ideas of being ('有') and non-being ('无'). These shifting interpretations hint at growing philosophical debates focused on existence and the cosmos.

            <li>
              Although the wording is unchanged, the philosophical landscape of the time shapes its understanding:
            </li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>
                In the era of Guodian/Mawangdui, there's a palpable focus on practical Daoism—emphasizing how the Dao quietly but profoundly moves and acts through reversion and subtle force, capturing the beauty and wisdom of nature.
              </li>
              <li>
                Later interpretations might weave these ideas into a tapestry of more formalized philosophy, suggesting that their application reaches into realms of governance and metaphysical inquiry, reflecting the complexities of human thought that mature over centuries.
