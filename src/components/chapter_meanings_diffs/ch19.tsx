          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"此三者以为文，不足" vs. "此三者以为文不足"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "These three things, by being treated as culture or artifice, are inadequate."</li>
              <li>Standard text: "These three things are treated as inadequate in culture or artifice."</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>
                  The Guodian/Mawangdui text appears to criticize the superficiality found in cultural practices of the time. It warns against the hollow embrace of societal norms when addressing profound life challenges, urging instead for a return to authenticity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In contrast, the standard text suggests a more resigned view—that these concepts, when superficially adopted into cultural norms, are insufficient. There's a hint of skepticism toward how society may use these ideas as mere slogans without true embrace.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>
                  The earlier text's focus reveals a dissatisfaction with using artifice to tackle deep-seated issues, perhaps reflecting a time when philosophy was more critically engaged with societal structures.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The later text shifts to questioning the deeper utility of these qualities when they become mere parts of decorum. It reflects a nuanced view that values depth and sincerity over performance.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"绝学无忧" vs. "少私寡欲"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "Cut off learning, and you will have no worries."</li>
              <li>Standard text: "Reduce personal desires and limit personal wants."</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>
                  The older text takes a bold stance against the pursuit of knowledge, hinting at a world where intellectualism might clutter the mind and bring unnecessary trouble. It challenges the pursuit of knowledge as a source of peace.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The later version tones this down, advocating for moderation in personal cravings and honing in on simplicity. This speaks to a growing awareness of the internal struggle with desires overshadowing other worries.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>
                  In the Guodian/Mawangdui, there's almost a radical call to shed intellectual weight, reflecting a time when perhaps pure, unburdened simplicity was sought after amidst societal complexity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Later thought suggests a slightly different quest: for personal discipline and the temperance of desires as pathways to serenity. This evolution points to increasing focus on inner emotional landscapes.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version offers a sharper critique of both cultural practices and intellectual pursuits:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>
                Critiques the inadequacy of addressing broader systemic problems through merely adopting cultural artifices; it urges going to the roots.
              </li>
              <li>
                Suggests that intellectual pursuits themselves might lead to societal unrest and personal disquiet. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The later standard text, meanwhile, shifts focus toward self-restraint and personal desires:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>
                Emphasizes personal responsibility and reducing desires to get closer to the Dao, fostering peace internally rather than critiquing systems externally.
              </li>
              <li>
                Highlights an evolving philosophical lens where the focus on reducing desires suggests a move toward internal, personal ethical behavior as a remedy for discontent.
              </li>
              <li>
                Both interpretations highlight a yearning to return to simplicity and naturalness but differ significantly in their approach—whether through societal critique or personal reform.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </div>
    );
