                <li><strong className="font-semibold">"谷神不死，是谓玄牝" through "用之不勤" (No textual difference)</strong></li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>Guodian/Mawangdui and Standard text: "The valley spirit never dies; it is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Continuous and enduring, use it without being exhausted."</li>
                    <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>The core text between the ancient and later versions remains the same, with no words or concepts explicitly altered.</li>
                        <li>The constancy in text suggests a consistent belief in the perpetual and intrinsic source of life and existence, represented by the Mysterious Female.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Continuity:</strong></li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>The idea of an eternal, unchanging source that provides endlessly aligns with the Daoist understanding of the Dao (Way) as an infinite and inexhaustible force.</li>
                        <li>Both the older and the later standard texts emphasize a metaphysical principle that remains central to Daoist philosophy, showing a deep reverence for the abstract and natural aspect of life.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The lack of textual difference between the Guodian/Mawangdui and the later standard text in Chapter 6 of the Dao De Jing indicates a rare consistency in interpretation:</li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>The passage reflects an enduring philosophical concept that remains unchanged over centuries, emphasizing its importance in Daoist thought.</li>
                    <li>This consistency may underscore the universality and timelessness of the principles being conveyed, illustrating a fundamental aspect of Daoist cosmology concerning the nature of existence.</li>
                    <li>The focus remains on the indefinable source of life — the Mysterious Female — as a pivotal element of the cosmos, suggesting its foundational role in the Daoist worldview.</li>
