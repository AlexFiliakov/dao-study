      <h3 className="font-bold">Key Differences and Their Implications:</h3>
      <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">"以其上求生之厚" vs. "以其求生之厚"</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "The people are light in death, because their rulers pursue a rich life, therefore they are light in death."</li>
          <li>Standard text: "The people are light in death, because they pursue a rich life, therefore they are light in death."</li>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version explicitly puts the responsibility on rulers ("其上"), suggesting that the rulers' greed and desire for indulgence lead people to disregard life itself as less valuable.</li>
            <li>The standard text, however, turns the spotlight onto the people, implying a broader human behavior. It suggests that the excessive longing for wealth and prosperity is a shared human flaw, leading to a general indifference to life’s preciousness.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The earlier text from Guodian/Mawangdui: Emphasizes a critical view of leadership, underscoring how rulers' excesses trickle down to influence societal values. It paints a picture of a top-heavy system where the actions of the mighty ripple through to the everyday lives of the many.</li>
            <li>The later text: Emphasizes human nature's tendency toward excess, depicting it as a shared challenge rather than one stemming purely from leadership failures. This shift mirrors a broader narrative—a more pervasive critique that includes everyone, not just those in power.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version leans heavily on leadership responsibility:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>This interpretation suggests that much societal distress is tied to the lavish pursuits of those at the helm, hinting at a consequential neglect of moderation by rulers that adversely affects the common good.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The standard text shifts focus to a universal perspective:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>By removing the spotlight from the rulers, the text broadens the narrative to our fundamental human nature, turning it into a call for restraint across the board. It highlights a universal lesson: the intrinsic value of simplicity and caution against unbridled desire.</li>
          <li>Though both texts advocate for simplicity and lessened desire, the distinctions in emphasis reflect nuanced understandings: the older text demands the self-discipline of leaders, while the later text invites all of humanity into the conversation about excess and its perils.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
