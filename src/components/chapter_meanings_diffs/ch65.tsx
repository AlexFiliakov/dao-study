      <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">"稽式" vs. "𥡴式"</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "Know these two and also look to the model (稽式, jí shì)." </li>
          <li>Standard text: "Know these two and also observe the model (𥡴式, jí shì)." </li>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The term 稽 (jí) in the older text carries an aura of "examining" or "inquiring into," inviting us into a world where investigation and contemplation reign supreme.</li>
            <li>In contrast, the character 𥡴 (jí) from the standard text leans toward "looking" or "observing," which paints the picture of a more straightforward engagement, possibly hinting at a less intense, less contemplative connection with the model.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Older text (Guodian/Mawangdui): This version seems to beckon a deeper dive into the very soul of principles and models, encouraging an active pursuit in the labyrinth of wisdom.</li>
          <li>Later text: The invitation here is more like a quiet, serene walk through nature, a passive observation, suggesting perhaps just to watch rather than to scrutinize deeply.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version is centered on active examination and wisdom gathering:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Here lies a proposal to inquire purposefully into foundational principles, to plunge into the study or deep contemplation of traditions or symbolic models of behavior or governance.</li>
          <li>This echoes the ancient Daoist pursuit of uncovering wisdom through meticulous understanding and inquiry.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The later standard text offers a more passive form of observation:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>It whispers the promise of experiencing and acknowledging without the fervor of deep engagement.</li>
          <li>This gentle shift could mirror a growing inclination toward harmonizing with the natural flow of the cosmos rather than the heroic act of shaping oneself through deliberate inquiry.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Broader Philosophical Implications:</h3>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>This evolution in text might illustrate the changing tides of Chinese philosophical thought:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>From a proactive engagement, possibly reflecting the turbulent yet hope-driven society of the Warring States period, to a later era's quiet observation, perhaps acknowledging the complexities and uncertainties of the Three Kingdoms period.</li>
          <li>It's as if the philosophical landscape itself was catching its breath, moving from the intense quest of inquiry to a peaceful expression of observation and reflection.</li>
        </ul>
