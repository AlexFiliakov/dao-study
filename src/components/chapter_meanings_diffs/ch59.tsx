            <li><strong className="font-semibold">Absence/Presence of certain terms</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: The phrase and character usage remain consistent across both the older and more standard text with no changes observed in terms of specific additions or omissions, indicating a cohesion in the overall message.</li>

                <li>The remarkable consistency between the two texts implies a strong agreement and preservation of thought from the earlier period to the time of the Three Kingdoms.</li>

          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui and standard versions share a unified view on the teachings in this chapter:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Both emphasize the importance of moderation (å•¬, "thrift") in governance as a means of maintaining alignment with both human and heavenly affairs.</li>
              <li>The notion that early adherence to thrifty practices builds a solid foundation of virtue, leading to stability and the potential for a long-lasting governance, is clearly outlined in both texts.</li>
              <li>The consistency across these texts suggests a shared and enduring understanding of the role of ethical cultivation in ensuring enduring prosperity and governance.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>It emphasizes that the essence of good governance and alignment with the Dao is a deep-rooted, sustainable approach that focuses on ethical principles and the avoidance of excess.</li>
              <li>The alignment in translation implies a strong cultural and philosophical emphasis that remained pertinent from the Warring States period through to the Three Kingdoms era.</li>
