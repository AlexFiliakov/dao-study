          <h3 className="font-bold">Key Differences and Their Implications:</h3>
          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">弱 vs. 弊</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "敝则新" (When worn-out, it becomes new)</li>
              <li>Standard text: "弊则新" (When worn-out, it becomes new)</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The two texts use characters with subtly different connotations. "敝" in ancient times suggests wear and tear in a more neutral way, while "弊" from the Three Kingdoms Period echoes a sense of being overwhelmed or exhausted. Both convey rejuvenation, yet the shift in tone hints at different attitudes towards the process of renewal.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Interpretation:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: Points to a natural cycle where endings lead to fresh starts, resonating with the era's broader views of change as inevitable and essential.</li>
                <li>Standard text: Emphasizes a balance, as if reminding the reader that the heaviness of exhaustion can be the soil from which new life springs. It embraces the give-and-take of life's journey.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implications of Commentary:</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Both versions invite us to see the wisdom in cyclical processes—where decline isn't just an ending, but a prelude to growth. The use of different characters to convey wear points to subtly varied perspectives on life's weariness and subsequent recovery.</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>Guodian/Mawangdui offers a raw, tangible sense of change:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>It taps into the organic process of decay giving birth to vitality, much like the seasons transitioning seamlessly through their natural course.</li>
              <li>The text feels grounded, urging one to find comfort in the cyclic nature of existence.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The standard text leans towards an exploration of equilibrium:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>The focus is on the coexistence of decline and renewal, reflecting a more tempered approach to understanding life's fluctuations.</li>
              <li>There's a gentle suggestion of introspection, finding strength and rejuvenation in inner processes as much as in outer change.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
