      <h3 className="font-bold">Key Differences and Their Implications:</h3>
      <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">"若肖，久矣其细也夫！" vs. "若肖久矣。其细也夫！"</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "If it resembled anything, it would long since have become insignificant!"</li>
          <li>Standard text: "If it resembled anything, it would have long since been small."</li>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>This passage from the Guodian/Mawangdui manuscripts paints the Dao as vast and unfathomable precisely because it never imitates or parallels anything else, suggesting its enduring magnificence.</li>
            <li>The standard text seems to trim this grandeur a bit, offering a more succinct expression of the same core idea. This brevity, however, trims some emotive force in highlighting the enduring mystery of the Dao.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Nuance:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The extra emphasis in the older text accentuates the Dao's elusive and unique strength, underlining the idea that the Dao's non-resemblance to anything is what sustains its majesty over time.</li>
            <li>Both texts capture the idea of the Dao's greatness, yet the older text adds a dramatic flair that highlights its infinite and unparalleled nature more vividly.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The earlier Guodian/Mawangdui version strikes a deeper chord with its stronger emphasis on the Dao's unparalleled and indomitable character:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>It forcefully reminds us that it is this very non-resemblance that renders the Dao both profound and endlessly enduring—a fascinating concept that invites contemplation.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The later standard text, while conveying the essence of the same philosophical insight, achieves this with a modicum of simplicity:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Its succinctness subtly mutes the insistence on the Dao's unique qualities, shaping a less dramatic yet still profound message.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Both iterations lead us to a shared understanding: the immeasurable greatness of the Dao lies in its unyielding and exceptional nature, inviting each reader on a timeless journey to ponder its endless significance.</li>
      </ul>
