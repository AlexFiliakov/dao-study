          <h3 className="font-bold">Key Differences and Their Implications:</h3>
          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"赘形" vs. "赘行"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>In the ancient Guodian/Mawangdui manuscript, we find "余食赘形" (yú shí zhuì xíng), which paints a vivid picture of how excessive food can lead to a burdensome physical form.</li>
              <li>The later, so-called standard text shifts this imagery slightly by using "馀食赘行" (yú shí zhuì xíng), suggesting that overindulgence results in cumbersome behavior or actions rather than just affecting one's physical conditions.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The older version, with "形" (xíng) for form, suggests a philosophy deeply concerned with how excess can manifest physically, leading to tangible and undesirable transformations in one's body.</li>
                <li>By contrast, the later text's use of "行" (xíng) for action expands this cautionary scope to include conduct, hinting at how indulgence can cloud judgment and result in clumsy, unaimed movements in life.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Rooted in a world where physical presence was paramount, the ancient script hints at societal preoccupations with the visible, tangible effects of excess.</li>
                <li>The standard text embraces a more abstract, perhaps introspective approach, looking beyond appearances and pondering how excess influences one's actions and decisions.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"不居" vs. "不处"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>In the Guodian/Mawangdui texts, "有道者不居" (yǒu dào zhě bù jū) implies that those who are aligned with the Way remain steadfastly away from excess, choosing not to inhabit or settle into it.</li>
              <li>Meanwhile, the standard version's phrase, "有道者不处" (yǒu dào zhě bù chù), implies a more temporary avoidance, as if wise individuals choose not to remain in a place of excess, without necessarily closing the door on ever encountering it briefly.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>"居" (jū) reflects stability and perhaps a long-standing immersion, hinting at a state one must firmly avoid.</li>
                <li>In contrast, "处" (chù) has a more fleeting, ephemeral feel, as if advocating for a responsive, more fluid approach to encountering excess in life's journey.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The earlier text talks about a life harmonized through constant and conscious decisions to distance oneself from physical and societal excesses, almost as if crafting an enduring legacy of simplicity.</li>
                <li>The later version feels more adaptable, highlighting the importance of transient decisions that allow one to navigate and sidestep the pitfalls of excess without rigid permanency.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui text speaks with the wisdom of a time rooted in tangible realities:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>It reflects a world deeply engaged with the adverse physical transformations resulting from indulgence, urging individuals to cultivate a life of simplicity.</li>
              <li>The phrase "not residing in excess" suggests that enduring avoidance of physical and social bloat is key, resonating with a spirit of lasting commitment to restraint.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The standard text, a product of perhaps more complex societal dynamics, opens up thoughtful avenues of reflection:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>It shifts focus to the subtleties of actions and behaviors born from excess, inviting readers to consider how their choices ripple through their actions.</li>
              <li>Choosing "not to dwell in excess" captures a more harmonious, adaptable spirit, calling for astute mindfulness amid ever-changing life circumstances.</li>
              <li>While the core message against excess resonates through both versions, each offers a unique lens: the former fixating on physical and social manifestations, and the latter attuning readers to the influences on personal conduct and life choices.</li>
