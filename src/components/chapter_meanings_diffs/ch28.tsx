          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">Position of "知其荣，守其辱" in the Texts</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>The ancient Guodian/Mawangdui text features "知其荣，守其辱" (Know the honor, keep to the disgrace) closely following "知其雄，守其雌" (Know the male, keep to the female), suggesting immediate progression from physical to societal realms.</li>
              <li>In contrast, the standard text places "知其白，守其黑" (Know the white, keep to the black) in between, postponing the societal context to establish a framework of contrasts first.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The sequence in the Guodian/Mawangdui text highlights an interconnectedness between physical attributes and societal values, portraying them as layers of human experience.</li>
                <li>By contrast, the standard sequence emphasizes the need to understand and balance life's ambiguities before engaging with societal values, suggesting that the internal understanding of dualities provides the foundation for societal interaction.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Evolution:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The older text offers a glimpse into a worldview where personal and societal elements coalesce more naturally, underscoring the seamless integration of individual and communal existence.</li>
                <li>The later text reflects a philosophical journey that begins with resolving internal dichotomies, which then extends outwards into understanding roles within the broader societal fabric.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"大智不割" versus "大制不割"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui text ends with "大智不割" (Great wisdom is not cut off), suggesting that personal wisdom remains whole and inviolate throughout life’s challenges.</li>
              <li>The standard text concludes with "大制不割" (Great governance is not cut off), focusing on the enduring nature of systems and structures.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The term "大智" evokes an ideal of inner wisdom that remains unbroken, embodying a deeply personal journey into understanding.</li>
                <li>Conversely, "大制" shifts attention to the macro level of order and systems, indicating a philosophical direction concerned with the stability and efficacy of governance.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Transition:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The ancient text encapsulates a belief in the unassailable nature of personal insight that anchors the individual irrespective of external disturbance.</li>
                <li>The later adaptation moves towards asserting the importance of robust governance structures as an extension of the harmony within an individual, suggesting that personal balance is mirrored and magnified in collective systems.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>In the Guodian/Mawangdui version, there's a palpable sense of intimacy with personal wisdom:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>The text appears to call for embracing contradictions within oneself, implying that true wisdom is born from this internal dialogue.</li>
              <li>It paints a journey that commences with tangible realities, gradually transitioning into realms of collective significance, all the while highlighting the wisdom-centered approach.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The later standard text broadens its horizon to emphasize societal balance and governance:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>The narrative portrays personal harmony as inextricably linked with expansive governance ideals, suggesting that individual balance finds reflection in societal structures.</li>
              <li>By centralized the focus on governance, it aligns personal well-being with the notion of a stable and orderly society.</li>
              <li>Even as both interpretations advocate for embracing opposites and striving for balance, they differ in where this pursuit finds its true resonance—within the heart’s wisdom or the justice of governance.</li>
