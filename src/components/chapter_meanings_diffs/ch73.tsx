      <h3 className="font-bold">Exploring the Shifts in Philosophical Thought:</h3>
      <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">The Missing Phrase "是以圣人犹难之"</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: Omits "是以圣人犹难之," which translates to "therefore, even the sage finds it difficult."</li>
          <li>Standard Text: Includes this phrase, highlighting the struggles even a wise sage faces.</li>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">What This Implies:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>In the older texts, the absence suggests a focus on the intrinsic qualities of the "Heaven's Way" (天之道) without human limitations. It paints a picture of the Dao as an inevitable cosmic order, somewhat detached from human interpretation or struggle.</li>
            <li>In contrast, the more recent addition to the standard text acknowledges human frailty, hinting at a sympathetic understanding of the sage's plight. It provides a human lens through which the Dao is comprehended, emphasizing our limits in grasping its entirety.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Transition:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: Remains abstract, presenting the Dao as an omnipresent truth, less concerned with individual struggles and more with its cosmic principles.</li>
            <li>Standard Text: Shifts to incorporating human introspection, reflecting on the challenges and complexities even the most enlightened face in understanding the Dao.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">A Deeper Look at Interpretations:</h3>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version presents the Dao's qualities as constant and inevitable, portraying the Dao as an impersonal force with its workings unaffected by individual comprehension or lack thereof.</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>This version seems to resonate more with a worldview where humans are witnesses to the grandeur of the Dao, without the need to interpret or struggle against it.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The later standard text offers a more human-centered approach, recognizing the complexities in human understanding of the Dao.</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>The acknowledgment of difficulty adds depth to the philosophical discourse, involving empathy and introspection, hinting at a journey towards understanding that is fraught with challenges yet essential for growth.</li>
          <li>Corrections like changing 穨 to 踈 are minor and don't alter the essence, yet they remind us of the ever-evolving nature of language and meaning.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Reflecting on the Evolution:</h3>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>Acknowledging both perspectives offers a richer, more nuanced picture of the historical shifts in Chinese philosophical thought.</li>
        <li>These changes illustrate not just a philosophical evolution, but also an increased appreciation for human agency and the complexities inherent in the journey to understanding profound truths.</li>
