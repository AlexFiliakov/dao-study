            <li><strong className="font-semibold">Omission of "是以圣人犹难之"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: Does not include the phrase "是以圣人犹难之" which means "therefore, even the sage finds it difficult."</li>
              <li>Standard text: Includes the phrase "是以圣人犹难之," emphasizing a challenge faced even by the sage.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The absence of this phrase in the older text may suggest a perspective that does not explicitly highlight the difficulty or challenge faced by the sage, focusing instead on the inherent qualities of "Heaven's Way" (天之道).</li>
                <li>The presence of this phrase in the standard text introduces a more explicit recognition of the sage's challenge in understanding or aligning with the Dao, suggesting a deeper acknowledgment of human limitation in comprehending the Dao.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Earlier text (Guodian/Mawangdui): Keeps the discussion more abstract, possibly focusing on the inherent nature of the Dao without reference to human struggles.</li>
                <li>Later text: Emphasizes human limitations in understanding or applying the Dao, highlighting the complexities even sages face.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version focuses more on the constant and inevitable qualities of the Dao:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>The text emphasizes the qualities of the Dao, such as non-contention and all-encompassing nature without diverting to challenges faced by individuals.</li>
              <li>This version may portray the Dao as a more objective, detached force, highlighting its inevitability and the nature of its workings without acknowledging human limitations directly.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The later standard text introduces a more human-centered perspective:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>It acknowledges the difficulty even sages find in understanding the Dao, suggesting a more philosophical approach to human understanding of the Dao.</li>
              <li>This additional statement may reflect a more developed philosophical discourse by this later period, incorporating reflections on human experience and limitations.</li>
              <li>Error correction in the character 穨 to 踈 in both versions represents minor variations that do not significantly impact meaning.</li>
