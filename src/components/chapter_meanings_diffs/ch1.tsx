        <h3 className="font-bold">Key Differences in Meaning and Interpretation:</h3>
        <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"道，可道也，非恒道也" vs. "道可道，非常道"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "Dao, if it can be spoken of, is not the constant Dao."</li>
                <li>Standard text: "The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao."</li>
                <li>The word “恒” (héng, constant/perpetual) in the older text was later replaced by “常” (cháng, normal/eternal) in the received version.</li>
                <li>Implication: The Guodian/Mawangdui version emphasizes that the Dao is not perpetually (恒) the same when expressed, suggesting fluidity and transformation. The received text’s use of “常” (eternal/unchanging) implies a more static metaphysical truth.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"名，可名也，非恒名也" vs. "名可名，非常名"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Similar change of 恒 (perpetual) to 常 (eternal)</li>
                <li>Philosophical Implication: The Guodian/Mawangdui text suggests that names and labels change over time, whereas the received text implies that names are inherently incapable of capturing the true essence of something.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"无，名万物之始也；有，名万物之母也" vs. "无名天地之始；有名万物之母"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "Non-being is called the beginning of all things; Being is called the mother of all things."</li>
                <li>Standard text: "The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; The Named is the mother of all things."</li>
                <li><strong className="font-semibold">Key Difference:</strong></li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>The older text directly names 无 (wú, non-being) and 有 (yǒu, being) as conceptual entities, whereas the received text associates them with naming (i.e., "the nameless" rather than just "non-being").</li>
                    <li>Implication: The older version treats 无 (non-being) and 有 (being) as ontological categories, while the received text links them more explicitly to language and perception.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"故恒无欲也，以观其眇" vs. "故常无欲，以观其妙"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "Therefore, if one constantly has no desires, one observes its subtle (眇, miǎo)."</li>
                <li>Standard text: "Therefore, one who is always without desires observes its wonder (妙, miào)."</li>
                <li><strong className="font-semibold">Key Change:</strong></li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>眇 (miǎo) means subtle, tiny, barely perceptible.</li>
                    <li>妙 (miào) means profound, marvelous, mysterious.</li>
                    <li>Implication: The older text suggests that the Dao is nearly imperceptible and delicate (眇), while the received text emphasizes awe-inspiring wonder and mystical profundity (妙).</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"恒有欲也，以观其所噭" vs. "常有欲，以观其徼"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "If one constantly has desires, one observes its loud cries (噭, jiào)."</li>
                <li>Standard text: "If one always has desires, one observes its manifestations (徼, jiào)."</li>
                <li>噭 (jiào) means a loud sound, a cry, something raw and immediate.</li>
                <li>徼 (jiào) means something fleeting or superficial.</li>
                <li>Implication: The older text suggests that desire leads one to experience the noisy and chaotic aspect of reality, while the later text suggests it leads to temporary and superficial manifestations.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"两者同出，异名同谓" vs. "此两者，同出而异名，同谓之玄"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "These two arise together; different names, but refer to the same."</li>
                <li>Standard text: "These two arise together but have different names, and they are both called 'mystery' (玄, xuán)."</li>
                <li><strong className="font-semibold">Key Difference:</strong></li>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>The older text avoids directly labeling them as "mystery", maintaining a more neutral stance.</li>
                    <li>The received text explicitly categorizes them as "mystery", adding a more metaphysical tone.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"玄之又玄，众眇之门" vs. "玄之又玄，众妙之门"</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "Mystery upon mystery, the gateway to all subtle things."</li>
                <li>Standard text: "Mystery upon mystery, the gateway to all wonders."</li>
                <li>眇 (subtle) in the older text vs. 妙 (wonder/mystical) in the standard text again reflects a shift from subtle perception to mystical profundity.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Philosophical Implications:</h3>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>Guodian/Mawangdui text reflects an early, pre-Qin Daoist perspective, where the Dao is changeable, subtle, and nearly imperceptible, and language only approximates it.</li>
            <li>The received text (Three Kingdoms era) shifts toward a more mystical and metaphysical interpretation, emphasizing Dao as an eternal and wondrous truth rather than a subtle interplay of imperceptible forces.</li>
            <li>The shift from "perpetual" (恒) to "eternal" (常) signals a move from a dynamic to a more absolute conception of Dao.</li>
            <li>The earlier text treats Dao as a process unfolding in real-time, while the later text treats it as a more transcendent, mystical principle.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Thoughts:</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">The Guodian/Mawangdui version presents a Dao that is fluid, difficult to grasp, and closely tied to observable, natural processes. It is a philosophical reflection on perception and reality rather than a mystical doctrine. The later received version leans toward religious Daoism, emphasizing the mystical, profound, and eternal aspects of Dao.</p>
        <p className="mt-2">Both versions capture the core idea of Dao’s ineffability, but their nuances reflect an evolving Daoist tradition—one that shifted from a pragmatic, observation-based philosophy to a more mystical, transcendental framework over centuries.</p>
