        <li><strong className="font-semibold">“抗兵相若” vs. “抗兵相加”</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: “When fighting armies are evenly matched (抗兵相若, kàng bīng xiāng ruò), the side that mourns will win.”</li>
          <li>Standard text: “When fighting armies become entangled (抗兵相加, kàng bīng xiāng jiā), the side that mourns will win.”</li>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>抗兵相若 (kàng bīng xiāng ruò) paints a picture of a warfare environment where opposing forces truly match each other in strength. This emphasizes a poetic and almost serene parity.</li>
            <li>抗兵相加 (kàng bīng xiāng jiā), on the other hand, conjures the imagery of a chaotic clash, where forces merge in a struggle that defines complexity and intensity.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Evolution:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The first text (Guodian/Mawangdui) guides us toward a view of balance in conflict, where victory stems from qualities more ethereal than tangible, such as mourning and reflection.</li>
            <li>The later text leans into the difficult nature of warfare itself, suggesting that complexity and conflict are inherent. Here, introspection during entanglement leads to triumph.</li>
            <li>This represents a shift from a focus on balance to an emphasis on the intricate dance of conflict, from the art of rivaling to the art of entangling.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Reflective Interpretation:</h3>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui text shines a light on warfare as a harmonious contest:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Here, evenly matched forces uncover a path to victory not through sheer power but through the subtle strength of internal qualities.</li>
          <li>There’s a quiet insistence on leadership that bears the weight of war, urging leaders to consider compassion and reflection as the keys to true success.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>Contrastingly, the later standard text delves into the complications of engagement:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>It paints a scene filled with the tangled web of conflict, emphasizing the unpredictable and often chaotic nature inherent in war.</li>
          <li>This text retains the guiding principle that emotional insight and depth bring a strategic advantage, a thread running through the tapestry of Daoist thought.</li>
          <li>Both iterations resonate with the recognition that mindful, emotionally aware leadership triumphs, celebrating the power of humility and substance over raw force.</li>
        </ul>
