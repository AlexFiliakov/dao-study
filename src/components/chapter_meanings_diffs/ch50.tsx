                <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li><strong className="font-semibold">"人之生，动之于死地" vs. "人之生，动之死地"</strong></li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "People in their life, move to the place of death, also ten out of three. But why? Because of their substantiality in life."</li>
                        <li>Standard text: "People in their life, move to the place of death, ten out of three."</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
                        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                            <li>The phrase "于死地" in Guodian/Mawangdui suggests a sense of movement or progression towards a state of danger or death, perhaps implying a pathway to death influenced by certain actions or circumstances.</li>
                            <li>The standard text lacks the additional "于" ("to" or "towards"), focusing instead directly on the idea of being within a "deadly territory", without the sense of movement or process being suggested.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
                        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                            <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: Emphasizes the actions that lead people towards danger or death and associates it with living excessively or having a life too thickly inexplicable by external desires or influences.</li>
                            <li>Later text: Concentrates directly on the condition of being in a deadly state, without exploring the causes or paths leading there.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong className="font-semibold">"以其生之厚" vs. "以其生，生之厚"</strong></li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "Because their life is substantial."</li>
                        <li>Standard text: "Because of their lives, their lives are substantial."</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
                        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                            <li>The older text implies a direct relation between a "thick" or cluttered life and susceptibility to death due to foolish actions.</li>
                            <li>The standard text's repetition suggests a more abstract concept, implying that life itself inherently contains aspects that lead to heaviness or substantiality, perhaps commenting on the nature of existence.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
                        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                            <li>Earlier text (Guodian/Mawangdui): Focuses on how the quality and choices in life make one prone to dangers.</li>
                            <li>Later text: Generalizes this to an existential level, emphasizing life itself as inherently substantive.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
                <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version portrays a perspective where life choices about desires and existence bring about movement towards danger:</li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>It suggests a more active role of individuals in their plight due to overindulgence or failure to live simply.</li>
                        <li>Emphasizes the process and pathway to death through actions influenced by desires and material life.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                    <li>The later standard text moves towards interpreting life substantively on a more intrinsic and existential level:</li>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                        <li>Lacks the element of moving towards danger, instead placing the individual more directly in a condition defined by existence.</li>
                        <li>Presents life as inherently possessing substantiality that must be navigated, suggesting philosophical contemplation over physical action.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
