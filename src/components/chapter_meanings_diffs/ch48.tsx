      <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">No text variations between ancient scripts and standard versions</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>The script remains unchanged in both the Guodian/Mawangdui texts and the later standardized versions. This marks an extraordinary consistency in the transmission of wisdom, echoing timeless principles across centuries.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">Interpretational shifts influenced by historical context</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Although the text is identical, the interpretation may ebb and flow, reflecting cultural tides and philosophical priorities of their respective eras:</li>

          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>"为学日益，为道日损" can stir different reflections depending on the era's pulse. The emphasis during the Warring States era may be on stripping away complexity to achieve harmony—a reflection of the turbulent socio-political struggles. Fast forward to the Three Kingdoms period, and the focus might gently pivot towards the personal journey of shedding attachments in the pursuit of spiritual purity.</li>

      <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Philosophical Context:</h3>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The concept of "无为而无不为" carries profound philosophical weight that evolves over time:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>In earlier days, this idea may resonate with rulers advocating for minimal interference in governance, a way to allow the natural ebb and flow of societal order. This could've been a soothing balm for discordant times where simplicity promised peace.</li>
          <li>Later, the whispers of this philosophy might appeal more intimately to individuals seeking spiritual transformation—embodying a personal practice rather than a mere political strategy. Imagine the monk or the scholar, letting go to grasp the infinite.</li>
          <li>Consider the final line, “及其有事，不足以取天下.” It gracefully cautions against the perils of forced action, whether in the grand theater of governance or the solitude of personal growth. Still, it invites us to reflect on the limitations of control—whether over empires or emotions—in any age.</li>
