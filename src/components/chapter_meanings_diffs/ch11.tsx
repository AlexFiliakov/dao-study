          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"有" and "无" in Ancient Context vs. Later Context</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Both Texts: Imagine a wheel with thirty spokes sharing a single hub; it's that empty space (无, wú) inside the hub that gives the wheel its function. Shape clay into a vessel, and it's the hollow (无, wú) inside that gives it purpose. Carve doors and windows into walls, and it’s the voids (无, wú) you create that allow for life within a house. Thus, what exists (有, yǒu) brings advantage and what does not (无, wú) provides true usefulness.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>The tension between "有" (yǒu) and "无" (wú) forms a crucial aspect of Daoist philosophy, underscoring the dance between presence and absence across time.</li>
                <li>Shifts in interpretation through the ages reveal subtle changes in how these ideas resonate within their evolving philosophical landscapes.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">Conceptual Interpretation Across Time</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>The core idea that utility springs from emptiness remains steadfast, yet the colors it takes may vary, painted by its surrounding cultural and historical context from 300-200 BCE to 240 AD.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>In earlier contexts, these principles might be connected to the tangible and immediate world, reflecting simpler societal needs or craftsmanship skills familiar to all.</li>
                <li>By the Three Kingdoms period, there's a possibility for layers to unfold, adding an abstract twist or a deeper introspection influenced by intensifying philosophical debates of the era.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui texts cling closely to the tangible, applying absence as a practical concept with clear, everyday examples:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>The wheel, the vessel, and the house serve as bridges linking daily life to profound philosophical truths, making the abstract accessible and real.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>During the era of the Three Kingdoms, interpretations breathe in added complexity and nuance:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Metaphysical dimensions might have been given more attention as thinkers of the time sought to peel back layers of existence and delve into the unseen or undervalued.</li>
              <li>This text insists on the Daoist principle of re-evaluating what society takes for granted, daring to suggest that true value might lie in what goes unnoticed, proposing an inversion of conventional beliefs.</li>
              <li>Though anchored in core Daoist teachings, the later interpretations might reveal a world more open to theoretical abstraction and an embrace of more personalized insight.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </div>
