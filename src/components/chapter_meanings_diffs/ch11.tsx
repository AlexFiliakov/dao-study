          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">"有" and "无" in Ancient Context vs. Later Context</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>Both Texts: "Thirty spokes share one hub; it is the empty space (无, wú) within the hub that makes it useful as a wheel. Shape clay into a vessel; it is the empty space (无, wú) within that makes it useful as a vessel. Chisel out doors and windows, it is the empty spaces (无, wú) within the structure that make it useful as a house. Therefore, presence (有, yǒu) leads to advantage/benefit, absence (无, wú) leads to utility/usefulness."</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>In both ancient texts, the concept of "有" (yǒu) and "无" (wú) is fundamental, highlighting the interplay between existence and non-existence that is central to Daoist philosophy.</li>
                <li>The difference may lie in the nuances of interpretation over time, potentially affecting how these ideas fit within broader philosophical contexts of their respective periods.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong className="font-semibold">Conceptual Interpretation Across Time</strong></li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>The focus on "utility derived from absence" remains consistent, but interpretations and applications in philosophical discourse might differ due to cultural and historical shifts between 300-200 BCE and 240 AD.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
              <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                <li>Earlier texts might emphasize these concepts more in terms of practical, observable outcomes related to their immediate cultural context, such as simpler societal systems or craftsmanship traditions.</li>
                <li>Later interpretations during the Three Kingdoms period may begin to integrate more abstract or introspective layers, potentially influenced by increased philosophical and metaphysical discourse during that era.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui texts adhere strongly to practical implications of absence as a utility in a straightforward, perhaps less abstract manner: </li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>This emphasis can be seen in the use of examples like a wheel, vessel, and house, directly tying everyday objects to philosophical meanings.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The later standard text during the Three Kingdoms period might engage with additional layers of philosophical interpretation:</li>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
              <li>There may be more focus on the metaphysical significance of presence and absence, as philosophical thought evolves and gains complexity.</li>
              <li>This text continues to reinforce Daoist principles of valuing what is often unseen or unvalued, proposing an inversion of common value structures as a means to greater understanding or utility.</li>
              <li>Both versions retain Daoist core tenets, but later interpretations potentially reflect an era of deeper theoretical abstraction and personalized application.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
