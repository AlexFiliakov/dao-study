            Guodian/Mawangdui: These ancient manuscripts speak to the heart of non-contentious leadership. They illuminate an era where wisdom was not about wielding power aggressively but about subtly guiding with grace and restraint.
          </li>
          <li>
            Standard text: Despite the passage of centuries, the core message remains intact. The words echo the same dedication to avoiding conflict and turning away from anger or arrogance.
          </li>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>
              Both versions insist on humility and strategic patience. In a world obsessed with prestige and dominance, these texts suggest that true strength lies in quiet control and generous collaboration.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Continuity:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>
              We see an unbroken line of thought underscoring the virtues of humility and indirect influence. They were as vital in ancient times as they are today for leaders and thinkers.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">Use of Language and Meaning</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>
            Guodian/Mawangdui: The language of this period brims with subtlety. Words once used might carry shades of meaning that speak directly to the values and ideals held dear in the Warring States era.
          </li>
          <li>
            Standard text: Over time, words evolve. By the Three Kingdoms period, the connotations of certain characters may have broadened, hinting at shifts in cultural or political contexts.
          </li>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>
              As meanings shifted, the understanding of virtues and ideal traits in leadership adapted slightly. Nonetheless, the essence of the Dao's message—that of integrity and modesty—remains a steadfast beacon through changing times.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>
              While the text may seem to maintain its ancient integrity, even slight linguistic nuances could encompass subtle shifts, delivering timeless values like “usefulness through humility” in a way that resonated across generations.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>Both Guodian/Mawangdui and standard texts offer coherent thoughts on non-contention:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>
            With poetic clarity, they present moral lessons deeply tied to the ethical fabric of ancient times—lessons that embraced virtue as the guiding light for personal and communal harmony.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>Later standard text remains true to the original message but adapted linguistically for a new era:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>
            The enduring wisdom of Daoist philosophy is woven into the very language of this era—its sustenance and relevance reflected in its continued embrace across the ages.
