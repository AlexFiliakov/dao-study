      <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>
          <strong className="font-semibold">"报怨以德，安可以为善" vs. "安可以为善"</strong>
        </li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "To repay resentment with virtue, how can this be considered good?"</li>
          <li>Standard text: "How can this be considered good?"</li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong>
          </li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The older text brings into focus the deliberate questioning of whether responding to negativity with kindness truly represents a noble path. This reflects an era that might have been grappling with the practicality of such ideals.</li>
            <li>The omission in the later text simplifies the inquiry to a broader philosophical level, perhaps signaling a shift towards more abstract contemplation over specific moral actions.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Evolution:</strong>
          </li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>The earlier version challenges the reader, pushing them to reconsider commonly held beliefs about virtue and its role in personal relationships. There's a rawness in questioning whether goodness can or should be pragmatic.</li>
            <li>By contrast, the later text encourages readers to ponder on the nature of good itself, broadening the moral inquiry but distancing it slightly from the realities of daily interactions.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version feels more intense and action-oriented:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>It presents a stir of skepticism, as if questioning whether real-world virtuosity is commendable or even feasible, pushing readers to look at virtue not just as an ideal, but as a concept that needs scrutiny and debate.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The later standard text provides a broader philosophical canvas:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>It steps back from the immediacy of personal moral strategies, posing a timeless question that nudges thinkers towards reflections on the essence of goodness rather than its application.</li>
          <li>This shift perhaps indicates a growing collective desire for philosophical generality, underscoring a society increasingly at ease with abstract reflection over pragmatic guidance.</li>
          <li>While both versions cherish Daoist simplicity, the older text dares to spotlight tangible challenges, while the later adaptation gently nudges towards a meditative exploration of virtue itself.</li>
        </ul>
