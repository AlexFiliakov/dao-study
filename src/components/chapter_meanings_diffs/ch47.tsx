      <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li><strong className="font-semibold">"不见而明" vs. "不见而名"</strong></li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Guodian/Mawangdui: "Not seeing and yet being enlightened (不见而明, bù jiàn ér míng)."</li>
          <li>Standard text: "Not seeing and yet being well-known or named (不见而名, bù jiàn ér míng)."</li>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Implication:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>
              The earlier usage of 明 (míng, "clarity/enlightenment") in the Guodian/Mawangdui version offers a glimpse into the heart of Daoist thought—where understanding blossoms from within, free from reliance on the outside world's chaos.
            </li>
            <li>
              In contrast, the later text's 名 (míng, "name/renown") shifts the narrative to the outer realm, suggesting a kind of fame or influence that doesn't depend on physical presence. It’s like casting a shadow far longer than oneself, indicating a concern with reputation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong className="font-semibold">Philosophical Shift:</strong></li>
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>
              Earlier text (Guodian/Mawangdui): The focus is profoundly inward, accentuating personal enlightenment and innate wisdom over external validation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Later text: There's a marked shift towards how society perceives the individual, perhaps reflecting a growing complexity within the sociopolitical landscapes where reputation starts to mirror one's true worth.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-2">Final Interpretation:</h3>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The Guodian/Mawangdui version focuses on personal enlightenment and wisdom:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>
            This interpretation implies a journey inward where the secrets of the universe are revealed through quiet reflection and harmony with the Dao. It's about perceiving the vastness of the world without setting foot outside one's door.
          </li>
          <li>
            With the emphasis on 明 (míng), the text reverberates with the Daoist vision of attaining brightness of mind and spirit—seeing the truth not through the eyes, but through an enlightened heart.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <li>The standard text introduces a societal or external dimension:</li>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li>
            It touches on the notion that one might become influential or recognized without active engagement, a notion that might resonate with those who have experienced the power of reputation or the concept of legacy.
          </li>
          <li>
            This change could signify a shift in cultural or philosophical priorities—a world gradually entering greater complexity and treasuring the echoes one leaves behind, not just the wisdom one possesses.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Such shifts not only reveal the evolving nature of Chinese philosophical thought and societal concerns during these eras, but also raise questions about the balance between internal truth and external acknowledgment—time-honored themes still relevant today.
